DONE
====
* test refactoring
    - test coverage

* gdrive daemon: remove control thread
* Implement a bridge to hide concrete handler/detector classes
    - this enables switching to a dummy implementation for testing without a raspi 
    - create concrete implementations with abstract factory
* gdrive queue
    - should be exectued async after record
* Configure camguard as a daemon
    - add makefiles for systemd installation
